Background 81 Points of Interest As a software designer/developer like all of you, time is of the essence when meeting deadlines! This
example using the RichText control works great! Especially with the zoom in/out feature using the mouse wheel, and it added nice
graphical features which can be easily customized. However, I feel the urging need to program in C# and this example was only
provided in VB.NET... It was time to upgrade it 8c now, on with the show!
